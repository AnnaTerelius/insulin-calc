# Project iCalc
This project is an app to count how much insulin to take for different products.
It is for people with diabetes, and takes the personaldose and choosen products fetched from an open API and counts how much insulin the user needs including extra if bloodsugar is high. It saves the bloodsugar in the database and shows a diagram over saved values.

I build it in react, using useState, routes, links and MongoDB/mongoose.
